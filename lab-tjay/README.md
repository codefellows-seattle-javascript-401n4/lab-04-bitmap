# Bitmap Converter  

### Module Exported Values  

- grayImg - This takes the colors defined by the colorTable and balances them out for grey scale  

- invertImg - this flips the values of the colors to invert the image.  

- rgbImg - this can be used to give the image a color-masking.  

All the modules only play with the colorTable and return a re-written version of the image.
