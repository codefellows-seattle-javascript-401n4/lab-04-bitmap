For this lab I decided on creating one whole module that takes in a file path, an element that signifies the elements in a color array and a callback. Then it reads a file that takes in a file path and a callback. If there is an error it will return an error with a specific message of why there is an error. If not the file will be read and console logged that it was read. I then construct the meta data needed to make a bitmap file which takes in data. I then say where each category of the bitmap will exist in byte offsets. Then I call the area where the color array should be with a color array. Then comes the transformations. I say if the color array has a certain color in it take that color and transform it.
After the transformations are made to the bitmap I then make a buffer for the color array to make sure it has the right data I need. I then make one buffer that has all of the buffers I need. I then write a new file that takes in a path, a buffer, and a callback. If there is an error it will return an error, other wise return that there was no error and that the buffer was created.
